# Lab 1 — DevOps Info Service (Python)

## Framework Selection

**Choice:** Flask 3.1.0 — lightweight, familiar routing, simple JSON responses. Suits well for person not familiar with python backend developing.

| Framework    | Pros    | Cons    |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Flask    | Minimal, quick startup, large ecosystem    | Async support limited compared to FastAPI    |
| FastAPI    | Automatic docs, async-native    | Slightly heavier, needs uvicorn    |
| Django    | Batteries included, ORM    | Overkill for two endpoints    |

---

## Best Practices Applied

- Logging configured at startup; request logging via `before_request`
- JSON error handlers for 404/500 to keep API consistent
- Environment-based config (`HOST`, `PORT`, `DEBUG`) for portability
- Small, pure functions (`get_system_info`, `get_uptime`) to simplify testing

---

## API Documentation

- `GET /` — returns service metadata, system info, runtime (uptime, time, timezone), request info, endpoint catalog
- `GET /health` — returns status `healthy`, current timestamp (UTC ISO8601), and uptime seconds

---

## Example Commands

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/ | jq
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health | jq
```

## Challenges & Solutions
- Placeholder: document any runtime or environment issues encountered.
